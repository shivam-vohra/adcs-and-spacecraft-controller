# ADCS and Spacecraft Controller Simulation

This repository houses the state machine code for modeling the attitude determination controller within a spacecraft. Additionally, the changes of the spacecraft are also modeling in response to the controller.


## Running the Code
To run the code, clone the repository locally. Ensure that you have jupyter notebook on your laptop or some way of opening ipynb files (Visual Studio Code should suffice). Next, go to the MainSimulation.ipynb file. You can now run each cell or run all at the top of the file. The results will then be outputted directly.
